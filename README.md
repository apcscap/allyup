# Devpost Description
## 🤩 Inspiration
When one donates to an organization or charity they don't see where their donation goes towards. With our app, AllyUp, we're seeking to bring transparency and the intimate feeling of generosity back to donating. Users have the ability to choose what to donate as well as provide for the specific needs of their favorite organizations. The immediate impact people make when they click the donation button will put users into a positive feedback loop. Never stop giving!

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
Google Firebase was not syncing with our frontend registration and this was one of the most difficult challenges we faced. Our project revolved around users and unique entities who could have posts and donations linked to their accounts, so this roadblock felt like the make-or-break of the project! Nevertheless, we realized that we were not accessing the correct part of the requests, and after some tweaking, AllyUp was back and accessible to anybody who wanted to make an account.
