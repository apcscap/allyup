# Devpost Description
## 🤩 Inspiration
When one donates to an organization or charity, they don't see where their donation goes towards. With our app, AllyUp, we're seeking to bring the intimate feeling back to donating. Users can choose to donate what they feel like and provide for the specific needs of their favorite organizations. Donating will be more positively reinforced due to the immediate impact people will make when they donate.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into
Google Firebase was not syncing with our frontend registration and this was one of the most difficult challenges we faced. Our project revolved around users and unique entities who could have posts and donations linked to their accounts, so this roadblock felt like the make-or-break of the project! Nevertheless, we realized that we were not accessing the correct part of the requests, and after some tweaking, AllyUp was back and accessible to anybody who wanted to make an account.
